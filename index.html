			<h2>How it all started</h2>
			<p>Ioana Codrean is finishing her AP degree in Multimedia Design. When she
				chose content making specialization in the 3rd semester, she found her
				passion for graphic design. As a creative person, she knew this would be
				the best path to go with.
			</p><br />
			<p>
				After some time of collaborating with other designers, Ioana decided
				to establish her own start-up company. She put together her portfolio
				and started to share her work on different platforms. She built her brand
				on authenticity, quality over quantity and respecting the rules of design.
				The main value which represents her brand the best is “Less is more”.
			</p><br />
			<p>
				Now, Ioana is focusing on her skills to become a professional. Plus, she is
				concentrating on building her website and YouTube channel to give
				useful tips for beginners. By expanding her network, she is open
				to more collaborations.

			<p>
				On days working on projects for clients, Ioana plans her meetings and question for clients. Because she
				works alone, she is precise with her communication. Ioana makes sure she understands what the client
				exactly wants, so she can make the product unique and personalized. She contacts the client
				along the process, therefore she delivers an exceptional product.
			</p><br />
			<p>
				Other days, Ioana fills with expanding her skills and knowledge. She browses other designers' work to
				take inspiration. Also, she makes her marketing calendars where she plans the work ahead. She makes
				the seasonal content ahead and the calendar helps her to remind when she uploads. She keeps herself
				busy by making video content too, like tutorials for beginners.
			</p><br />
			<p>
				The day as a designer is busy and full of work. Ioana’s determination and passion for the graphic design
				guarantees her valuable work.

			<p>
				The creator of IC.Design thinks that it is way more difficult to become successful in this market when
				you are a woman. Reasoning behind it is that you need to prove what you are capable of, including that
				you have great skills as well. And even though Ioana knows that it can be challenging sometimes, she
				still has big plans for the future.
			</p><br />
			<p>
				One of her biggest goals is to finish her studies and become a professional graphic designer, improve
				her skills, the quality of her products and make a living out of it too. This goal is also followed by
				the desire to expand her business. Which means having more clients and expanding the circle of talented
				people she works with. IC.Design now focuses more on the food market; therefore, the creator of this
				startup really hopes to get more customers from this field. Another dream that she feels very motivated
				about is creating YouTube tutorials. Ioana wants to teach young and older people how to use Adobe apps
				and create logos, illustrations, edit photos etc. IC.Design still has a lot to accomplish but with great
				motivation and willingness its creator will reach these goals in no time.

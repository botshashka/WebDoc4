			<h2>How it all started</h2>
			<p>Ioana Codrean is finishing her AP degree in Multimedia Design. When she
				chose content making specialization in the 3rd semester, she found her
				passion for graphic design. As a creative person, she knew this would be
				the best path to go with.
			</p><br/>
			<p>
				After some time of collaborating with other designers, Ioana decided
				to establish her own start-up company. She put together her portfolio
				and started to share her work on different platforms. She built her brand
				on authenticity, quality over quantity and respecting the rules of design.
				The main value which represents her brand the best is “Less is more”.
			</p><br/>
			<p>
				Now, Ioana is focusing on her skills to become a professional. Plus, she is
				concentrating on building her website and YouTube channel to give
				useful tips for beginners. By expanding her network, she is open
				to more collaborations.

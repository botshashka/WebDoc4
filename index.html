			<h2>How it all started</h2>

				chose content making specialization in the 3rd semester, she found her
				passion for graphic design. As a creative person, she knew this would be
				the best path to go with.
			</p>
			<p>
				After some time collaborating with other designers, Ioana decided
				to establish her own start-up company. She created her portfolio
				and started sharing her work on various platforms. She built her brand
				on authenticity, quality over quantity and respecting the rules of design.
				The main value which represents her brand the best is “Less is more”.

			<p>
				On days when she works on her projects for clients, Ioana plans her meetings and questions for clients. Because she
				works alone, she is precise with her communication. Ioana makes sure she understands what exactly does her client want, so she can make the product unique and personalized. She communicates with her client throughout the process, therefore she delivers an exceptional product.
			</p>
			<p>
				On other days, Ioana spends time expanding her set of skills and knowledge. She browses other designers' work to take inspiration. She also makes her marketing calendars where she plans the work ahead. She makes
				the seasonal content ahead and the calendar helps her to remind when she uploads. She also keeps herself
				busy by making video content, such as beginner tutorials.
			</p>
			<p>
				The day as a designer is busy and full of work. Ioana’s determination and passion for the graphic design guarantees that she delivers on her promises.

			<p>
				The creator of IC.Design thinks that it is more difficult to become successful in this market if
				you are a woman. Reasoning behind it is that you need to prove what you are capable of, including that
				you have great skills as well. And even though Ioana knows that it can be challenging sometimes, her plan for the future remain big and ambitious.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of her biggest goals is to finish her studies and to become a professional graphic designer, to improve
				her skills, the quality of her products and to make a living out of it as well. This goal is also accompanied by a desire to expand her business. Which means having more clients and expanding the circle of talented
				people she works with. 
                <br><br>IC.Design now focuses more on the food market; therefore, the creator of this
				startup really hopes to get more customers from this field. Another dream that motivates her is creating YouTube tutorials. Ioana wants to teach young and older people how to use Adobe apps
				and create logos, illustrations, edit photos etc.<br> IC.Design still has a lot to accomplish but with great
				motivation and willingness its creator will reach these goals in no-time.
